In the beginning, before studying the types of programming languages, we must know how to convert this language to machine language so that the computer can understand it.

-Converting to machine languages
Regardless of what language you use, you eventually need to concert your program into machine language so that the computer can understand it. There are two ways to do this:
1) compile the program.
2) interpret the program.
At first we will talk about compile the program
To transform a program written in a high level programming language from source code into object code . programmers write programs in a form called source code. Source code must go through several steps before it becomes an executable program. The first step is to pass the source code through a compiler,
which translates the high level language  instructions into object code.
The final step in producing an executable program after the compiler has produced object code is to pass the object code through a linker.  The linker combines modules and gives real values to all symbolic addresses, thereby producing machine code.
If we want to know the other type, we must compare it to the other type

An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form, which it then executes. In contrast, a compiler translates high-level instructions directly into machine languages.
Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted programs. The advantage of an interpreter, however, is that it does not need to go through the compilation stage during which machine instructions are generated. This process can be time-consuming if the program is long.
The interpreter, on the other hand, can immediately execute high-level programs.For this reason, interpreters are sometimes used during the development of a program, when a programmer wants to add small sections at a time and test them quickly. In addition,
interpreters are often used in education because they allow students to program interactively.
And now we can study types of programming language such as:
   "Java language"
Java is a general purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented and designed to have as few implementing dependencies as possible. It is intended to allow application developers to write once, run anywhere (WORA),
meaning that compiled Java code runs without recompilation on all Java-supporting platforms.Java programs are usually compiled to bytecodes that can run on any Java virtual machine ( JVM), independent of the computer architecture underlying.
Java's syntax is similar to C and C++, but it does have fewer low-level facilities than either. By 2019,and Java was one of the most common programming languages used by GitHub, with 9 million developers registered, especially for client-server web applications.
Due to the limited available space we will display some of the syntax of java language: Java syntax is mostly inspired by C++. Unlike C++, which blends the syntax for structured, generic and object-oriented programming, Java was developed almost exclusively as an object-oriented language.
All code is written in classes, and each data element is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types.
(i.e. integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, and characters) that are not output artifacts. Java reuses some of the common C++ aspects (like the printf method).Unlike C++, Java does not allow the overloading of operators or multiple inheritance for classes, while interfaces support multiple inheritance.
Java makes close use of comments to those in C++. There are three different comment styles: one line style marked with two slashes (//),The multiple line style opened with / * and closed with * /, and the comment style of Javadoc opened with / * * and closed with *.
The Javadoc comment style allows the user to run the Javadoc executable to create program documentation, and some integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Eclipse, can be read to allow developers to access documentation within the IDE.
finally,The Java programming language needs the existence of a software framework for execution of compiled programs.
Oracle provides Java framework for Java use. The Android SDK is an alternative development framework, used mainly with its own GUI system for creating Android applications.and another important types is C++

                            "C++"
C++ is a popular general purpose programming language. It can be used for the development of operating systems, browsers, games, etc. C++ supports various programming types, such as procedural, object-oriented, functional and so on. That makes C++ both flexible and potent.
And if we touch on certain information about this language quickly we will find it Multi paradigm Language  where C++ supports at least seven different styles of programming. Developers can choose any of the styles.and General Purpose Language-C++ can be used to build games, desktop applications, operating systems, etc.
and it is characterized with Speed-The efficiency of optimized C++ code is exceptional as with C programming.
and Object-oriented-C++ lets you break complex issues into smaller sets using artifa and to learn this language we should know at first why we study it.
the answer will be Because of its performance, C++ is used to build games, mobile applications, operating systems, browsers etc.
Upon learning C++, learning other programming languages such as Java, Python, etc. would be much simpler.
C++ lets you understand a computer's internal architecture, how the computer stores information and retrieves it.There are many other programming languages ​​such as(C,C#,SQL and javasc
-SQL(structurestructure query language)
SQL is a database query language (not a development language) that allows for adding, accessing and managing content in a database. It is the language that allows programmers to perform the common acronym CRUD (Create; Read; Update; Delete) within a database.
and The people who use it are SQL server developers, database testers, software developers, database administand Used across industries like Information Technology, Engineering, Design, Management, Professional Servers, Business and FinanceFinance and its importance lies in SQL interacts with the backend database of web application.
It is the “de facto standard” database language, always used in conjunction with another programming language. SQL programs are implemented as a way for businesses and organizations to access and manipulate information stored in their databases.for example Relational database management systems that use SQL include MySQL (by Oracle), Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server and others.
and the advantages is that Simple syntax
and Free and easily accessible
