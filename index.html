A programming language is similar to speaking languages in many respects. It has an
alphabet (more commonly referred to as a character set) from which everything in the language is
constructed. It has rules for forming words (also called tokens), rules for forming statements, and
rules for forming programs. These are called the syntax rules of the language and must be obeyed when writing programs.
If you violate a rule, your program will contain a syntax error. When you
attempt to compile the program, the compiler will inform you of the error. You must correct it and try again.
The first step to becoming a good programmer is learning the syntax rules of the
programming language. This is the easy part, and many people mistakenly believe that this makes
them a programmer. It is like saying that learning some rules of English grammar and being able
to write some correctly formed sentences makes one a novelist. Novel-writing skills require much
more than learning some rules of grammar. Among other things, it requires insight, creativity, and
a knack for using the right words in a given situation.
In the same vein, a good programmer must be able to creatively use the features of the
language to solve a wide variety of problems in an elegant and efficient manner. This is the
difficult part and can be achieved only by long, hard study of problem-solving algorithms and
writing programs to solve a wide range of problems. But we must start with baby steps.
And These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex sections of information.
For example , if a person receives a list of randomized numbers ranging from 1 to 10,000 and is asked to place them in ascending order, it is likely to take a substantial amount of time and contain some errors.
