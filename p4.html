In this paper, I want to know what is meant by programming languages, how important they are for a person,
and their contribution to the tremendous technological development around us, and also to learn about its types.Like a language "python" and thus studying the advantages of this language and knowing its history,
as well as knowing who is interested in studying this language and then after that touching on another language like "java" and also knowing a lot of information about this language and likewise in a language "C++" and learn how to create a hotmail.
